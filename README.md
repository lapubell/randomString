# Silly little program to generate random strings

This program generates a random 32 char string, and adds it to your clipboard. Nothing too special about it, but it works like a champ.

# To install and use

* Make sure your $GOPATH is all set up correctly
* `go get ...`
* `go install`
* now, when you run `randomString` your clipboard should have a 32 character random string
